# credit-card-fraud-detection
• Collected a real-world credit card transaction dataset from the web and performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare for analysis.

• Conducted initial data assessment and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, anomalies, and key patterns in fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.

• Built a Logistic Regression model on the original (imbalanced) dataset, achieving an initial accuracy of 95%.

• Applied oversampling techniques (up-sampling the minority class) to address class imbalance and improve model fairness and sensitivity.

• Re-trained the model on the balanced dataset, maintaining a high accuracy score of 95%, with improved performance in fraud detection.
